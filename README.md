# First you need to download and install xampp(make sure mySQL is also installed ) and download the project. Once it is downloaded, run your apache and mysql server in xampp. Go to student management/frontend/src/resources, copy the whole content of your db_student.sql file and paste it into the SQL section in your phpMyAdmin page and run the code. Once you're done open the student management folder in vs code and create two bash terminals, in one enter 'cd .\backend" and in the other one enter 'cd .\frontend". You also need to execute the command "npm install" in both terminals. After that, In the backend terminal enter the command "npm start" and in the frontend one enter "npm run serve". From here everything should be fine and you can access the website.


You will need support for vue.js, node.js, express.js and mySQL(xampp is recommended )
